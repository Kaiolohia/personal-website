# My personal website

My goal for this site is to create a minimal and calm introduction to my skills within software engineering

## Techniques used

To accomplish this I forced my self to use only one library, react, to make the actual file size of the website as small as possible. Other than libraries, the only other imports I have is the one font used across the whole site. All icons and other things which could be accomplished using technologies like awesome font are instead created using my knowledge of css tricks.

## Feedback

Feedback is crucial for me, I am the only one working on this project which can lead to some bugs that go unseen. While I am trying my best to fix all bugs while developing the components, some may slip through that go unnoticed by me. So if you notice them it would be greatly apprecieated to leave either a comment on this repo or a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kai-dean-73846a217/)

## Final Notes

Enjoy!

## IMPORTANT

While this section is in the readme, this site is still under development and is not a final product. I will be uploading to this github any time I make an update and eventually this will become the final version. In the meantime expect the site to be incomplete, missing sections or flat out not work (mobile experience not implemented for example)
